            <h3>Building a Flight Simulator Control Box | Post Date: 10/08/2024</h3>
            <hr>
            <h4>How will it work?</h4>
            The core of this project is a very neat software called <a href="https://www.mobiflight.com/en/index.html" style="color: rgb(34, 129, 94)">Mobiflight</a> which allows you to easily interface an arduino style microcontroller with games such as Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. <br>
            I've played with this software in the past and 3d printed a little button box to try it. Overall it was a very good experience, but my box was designed very quickly and haphazardly. The goal of this project is to revise my previous design in a more luxery manner.
            <h4>What will it look like?</h4>
            I plan to make the case out of wood, or plastic with a wood venier. I am designing the box to fit on my desk and be approximately one foot by three inches in size, and be as deep as needed. The front panel I plan to be aluminum with backlit labels, and for connectivity I plan to terminate a USB cable with a more robust DIN plug. <br>
            The scope of this control panel will be simple auxilery functions in the Cessna 152, mainly power control and lighting.
            <h4>How will it be made?</h4>
            I am planning to spend alot of time working out the details in my designed, before finalizing an assembly file for manufacture. I know I will be having the faceplates CNC machined through an online service, though I dont have one in mind yet. I usually use JLC PCB for circuitboard simply because its cheap and I've had good luck with them. The wooden case will proove the most difficult, though I may be able to use a local makerspace's CNC.
