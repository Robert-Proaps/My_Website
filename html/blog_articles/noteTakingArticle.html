                <p>As a college student staying organized and on track is a must in my day to day. I am currently a Junior in my Mechanical Engineering program, and have tried various methods of planning and notetaking. I started my freshman year using the agenda I was given by my university. It wasn't a terrible planner, and I have incorporated many of its features into my current notetaking system. I later took all of my notes and planning digital using a combination of OneNote and Google Calendar. I had some luck using one note for my courses, but it fell short when it came to planning and I found it too easy to archive notes without reviewing them. Nowadays I use a system of all paper notebooks and in this article I would like to share that system with you.</p>
                <p>My notebook system is split into two purposes, planning and note taking. I will first go over my planning system which also incorporates some note taking and journaling. At the center of my planning system is  my Traveler's Notebook; a refillable leather-bound, modular notebook system that I keep with me whenever I can. I will later go over what I do when I cannot carry my Traveler's Notebook due to not having a bag or other reasons. This Traveler's Notebook fills three main roles and is divided into three sections. Firstly I have a section dedicated to planning; Each month I draw out a new calendar by hand and populate it with deadlines, goals, bills, and events, then if I am at the beginning of a semester I include a class list, and professor contact information. Throughout the month I use this planning book to write to-do lists, deadlines, and various other information.<br>
                In addition to my planner, my Traveler's Notebook contains a seperate section for notes and journaling. I use this section for keeping track of ideas, quotes, and specific to the field of applied sciences, any observations. This notebook also contains some blank paper for drafting out ideas and designs when they come to mind, so that they may be expanded upon in proper drawings at a later time. As my Traveler's Notebook is somewhat large and a bit heavy I also carry with me a pocket notebook which takes up no more room than a wallet. I use this notebook as a catch-all for tasks, to-do lists, ideas, and pretty much anything else. I then move items from this notebook to my Traveler's notebook when it is convenient and nessisscary. So far this notebook system has made it much easier for me to keep up with my workloads as well as stay on track.</p>
                <p>This next section will cover my Academic note taking system which I use throughout my coursework. My current modus-operandi of taking notes to best benefit my learning is heavily inspired by the video <i><a href="https://youtu.be/q41i0wpX4qc?si=Rk2XS7ub7cwGwmIW">You Need to Romanticize Your Process</a></i> by Tozak Filming. The main idea of this video is that it is much easier to enjoy working, or studying in my case, if you make the process itself enjoyable. While I utilize many methods to make studying enjoyable such as working in libraries and coffee shops I also found that having good notetaking tools makes the process much more enjoyable. I have moved away from binders and notebook paper to nice but inexpensive japanese single subject notebooks, specifically the <a href="https://www.kokuyostore.com/en_US/campus-notebook-set-of-5-color-7mm-dot-line-b5/NO-3CATNX5.html?acgid=campus-notebooks2-notebooks">Kokuyo Campus</a> notebooks. As an aside I would like to mention that I found the metric B5 size to be perfect for fitting on a desk with a keyboard on it. I have also moved from dollar store mechanical pencils and pens to nicer yet still affordable fountain pens, which through learning to use help me to slow down and remember my content better. These processes combined changed studying into an enjoyable past-time rather than a stop-gap measure between lectures and surviving tests.</p>
                <p>While I believe it is important to make a system that works for you, I hope that whoever finds this short article deep in the web can gather some inspiration and benefit from it.</p>
